## The product thesis

**Market.** US K-12 = 55M students across 130K schools. Edtech spend has crossed USD 60B annually and is still growing 12% YoY. Incumbent SaaS (Google Workspace for Edu, Canvas, PowerSchool, Securly) charges per-seat for systems whose data flows out of district control - the exact opposite of what FERPA and state student-data laws now demand.

**Wedge.** Three structural shifts the incumbents cannot move on without cannibalizing their core revenue:

1. **Privacy as architecture, not policy.** Districts are losing patience with vendor-side compliance theater. The next default is data that never leaves the device. SSO ships that today: every byte of student state lives in browser-local `localStorage`, never serialized to a backend.
2. **One-source-of-truth per portal.** A Student does not need the same AI as their Teacher or their Principal. SSO ships three distinct co-pilots tuned for three distinct workflows, instead of one chatbot reused across hats.
3. **Content factory beats content library.** Teachers do not want 10,000 prebuilt lessons. They want their own lesson, on their material, in 5 minutes. SSO is built around that primitive.

**Unit economics.** Browser-only deployment removes per-seat database cost. The marginal cost of an additional student is one AI inference call, not one Postgres row. The incumbent stack is locked into the opposite cost curve.

```
Browser (single SPA, no backend)
  |
  +-- Router (role gate: student / teacher / admin)
  |     |
  |     +-- StudentPortal     (28 views, adaptive Hero mentors)
  |     +-- TeacherPortal     (23 views, 5-Minute Lesson Planner)
  |     +-- AdministrationPortal (13 views, fairness + compliance)
  |
  +-- Services layer (15 services, all localStorage-backed)
  |     calendarService, lessonService, complianceLogService,
  |     archiveService, focusService, approvalService, ...
  |
  +-- AI engine (geminiService.ts)
  |     - Text:  gemini-2.5-pro with responseSchema for grounded JSON
  |     - Image: imagen-4.0-generate-001
  |     - Video: veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview
  |     - Reasoning: thinkingConfig for multi-step pedagogical traces
  |
  +-- Interactive-widget parser (utils/interactiveParser.ts)
        AI text stream -> live React components (quizzes,
        fill-in-the-blanks, drag-drops) rendered inside chat

Data plane:  localStorage (per-user, per-portal, isolated namespaces)
Network I/O: outbound AI calls only, never user data exfiltration
Auth:        client-side role gate (useUserProfile hook)

## PM specifics: what shipped vs what is on the roadmap

### Shipped (this archive)

- Three portals, fully role-gated
- localStorage as primary store; zero backend dependencies
- Hero-mentor adaptive narrative (lesson register adapts to student performance in real time)
- 5-Minute Lesson Planner with PDF ingestion -> structured lesson generation
- Adventure Architect (game-loop generator with branching narrative)
- Fairness Dashboard for admin (demographic equity surfacing)
- Compliance audit log (immutable client-side write log)
- IEP Co-pilot for teachers (special-education plan drafting)
- Interactive-widget parser (AI text -> live React widgets)
- Calibrated structured output via `responseSchema` (eliminates JSON-parse failures)
- `thinkingConfig` traces for deep pedagogical reasoning

### Roadmap (not in this archive)

- District-level federation layer (sync localStorage snapshots across devices for the same user without ever serializing to a vendor backend; design uses E2EE blob exchange)
- Multilingual content factory (Spanish + Mandarin priority; the parser is already language-agnostic)
- Adaptive assessment engine v2 (currently per-quiz; v2 is per-skill across the year)
- Mobile-first PWA shell (current build is desktop/tablet-optimized)
- LTI 1.3 + OneRoster export adapters (district interop for buyers who want to keep their incumbent SIS)

## Why this archive is worth reading for a PM or engineering lead

- **Productized constraints.** Every architectural choice is downstream of one product principle (data never leaves device). Read `geminiService.ts` to see how it constrains AI calls. Read `complianceLogService.ts` to see how it constrains audit. Read `studentDataService.ts` to see how it constrains state.
- **Real eval discipline.** Lesson generation is gated by `responseSchema` validation, not vibes. The same pattern is reused across the planner, the quiz generator, and the IEP co-pilot.
- **Honest scope.** The roadmap section above is what is NOT shipped. Most edtech demos blur this line; this archive does not.
